# CNN Classifier for Human, Cat, and Dog Images

## Overview
### This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to distinguish between images of humans, cats, and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and is capable of predicting the class of new, unseen images with 95.66 Accuracy.

## Dataset
### The dataset used for training and testing the model contains images of three classes:
* Humans
* cats
* dogs
### Each class have 1536 images of each class in training dataset and 384 images of each classes in testing dataset.

## Requirements
* Python 12.+
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Model Architecture
### The CNN architecture consists of the following layers:
